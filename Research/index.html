<h3>What is TrashIndex?</h3>
<p>TrashIndex is a common measurement to indicate the total amount of trash generated by the production, consumption, and disposal of a product.
The Index can be read by scanning the barcode of an item to a cellphone app. </p>
<h3>Why TrashIndex?</h3>
<p>TrashIndex measures how much burden a product is adding to our environment. The higher the index, the more harmful components are added to manufacture the product. It provides a guideline for the consumers to be environmental conscious when they make purchase decisions.
For instance, a salad packaged in a paper box will have a very low TrashIndex. On the contrary, a salad bowl in a plastic container will have a higher TrashIndex. 
If there are more environmental friendly products, there will be less trash to decompose on the earth. </p>

<h3>Our Current Problems</h3>
<p>Trash is becoming a larger and larger problem around the world. As human population grows, so does our waste. Most of the trash ends up in landfills. The products that include dangerous and harmful chemicals will cause pollution and will take longer to decompose. TrashIndex measures how harmful the materials are in a product. Consumers will buy products with lower TrashIndex. Their buying decisions will help the industries to make more environmental friendly products. 
</p>
<h3> How to Calculate TrashIndex</h3>
<h4>For A Leaf Product</h4>
(see formula on top, in section Imported from CCO/research.html)
<h4>For A Composite Product</h4>
<p>Let's say we have a composite product \(a\). It is made out of leaf products \(b,c,d\). The percentage of the leaf products are \(e,f,g\). The Trash Index of the leafs are \(h,i,j\).Then, the Trash Index is \(e\%h + f\%i + g\%j\).</p>
<h3>How do People Access the Trash Index</h3>
<p>First of all, our mobile application scans the UPC code of an item, such as a juice bottle or a luxury handbag. 
Then from the UPC code, our app will detect what materials the product is made up of and how much trash is generated to produce this product. 
After running the calculation, the app will generate an index number. A high number indicates materials will take longer to degrade and recyclability is low. A low index indicates the product is for earth friendly.
