    <h3>Please be sure to know your part very well. You MUST know the meaning and where your part is located on the poster board.</h3>
    <h2> IMPORTANT: MEMORIZE YOUR OWN TITLE!!!! ALSO, MEMORIZE THE TITLE AFTER YOURS FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF TRANSITIONING. </h2>
    <h2>Below are your parts. They are in order so it will be easy to make the transitions. <mark>Matthew</mark>will read both his title and the transitioning title.</h2>
    <h2>Remember after you read your part, read the transitioning slide. Then, the next person will read their part, and then the transitioning slide e.t.c.</h2>
    <h4><mark>Matthew</mark> ~ Slide: What is TrashIndex--Located: In the MIDDLE SECTION (first person talking) == Transitioning Title: Why TrashIndex (Wait after Myra reads the pop-ups on the side before you read the Transitioning Title.) </h4>
    <p>What you're going to say: TrashIndex is a common measurement to indicate the total amount of trash generated by the production, consumption, and disposal of a product. It measures how much burden a product is adding to our environment. </p>
    <h4><mark>Andrew</mark> ~ Slide: Why TrashIndex--Located: In the MIDDLE SECTION (second person talking) == Transitioning Title: Current Problems (Wait after Myra reads the pop-ups on the side before you read the Transitioning Title.)</h4>
    <p>What you're going to say: TrashIndex provides a guideline for the consumers to be environmental conscious when they make purchase decisions.
    For instance, a salad packaged in a paper box will have a very low TrashIndex. On the contrary, a salad bowl in a plastic container will have a higher TrashIndex. 
    If there are more environmental friendly products, there will be less trash to decompose on the earth. </p>
    <h4><mark>Ryan</mark> ~ Slide: Current Problems--Located: In the LEFT SECTION (third person talking) == Transitioning Slide: How do poeple access TrashIndex</h4>
    <p>What you're going to say: Trash is becoming a larger and larger problem around the world. As human population grows, so does our waste. Most of the trash ends up in landfills. The products that include dangerous and harmful chemicals will cause pollution. Also, these products will take longer to decompose. 
    Consumers will buy products with lower TrashIndex. Their decisions will help industries make more environment-friendly products.</p>
    <h4><mark>Michael</mark> ~ Slide: How Do People Access TrashIndex--Located: In the RIGHT SECTION (fourth person talking) == Transitioning Slide: Leaf Calculator</h4>
    <p>What you're going to say: First of all, our mobile application scans the UPC code of an item, such as a juice bottle or a luxury handbag. 
    Then from the UPC code, our app will detect what materials the product is made up of. After running the calculation, the app will generate a number. A high number indicates materials will take longer to degrade and recyclability is low. A low index indicates the product is earth friendly. </p>
    <h4><mark>Marvin</mark> ~ Slide: Leaf Calculator and Example(YOU WILL NEED TO KNOW PART VERY WELL SINCE THIS SLIDE ISN'T ON THE POSTER.)--Located: In the RIGHT SECTION (fifth person talking) == Transitioning Slide: Future Improvements for Our App</h4>
    <p>What you're going to say: This chart states the product, how long it takes to degrade, and the TrashIndex for the item. Below is an example. The item on this diagram is Box of Cashew Nuts. 92% of the box is made up of cashew nuts. The remaining 8%
    is made up of the plastic bottle. The plastic bottle is made up of 7% plastic and 1% plastic label. Following the formula, the Box of Cashews has a TrashIndex of 36.</p>
    <h4><mark>Myra</mark> ~ Slide: Future Improvements for Our App--Located: In the MIDDLE SECTION (sixth person talking) == Transitioning Slide: How will TrashIndex benefit the future</h4>
    <p>What I'm going to say: The current calculation algorithm is very simple and it can be further enriched and certified by scientists. For example, we have discussed to add Recyclability and Toxicity into our consideration. Our iOS version used external API to get the product information from barcode. 
    The Android version uses a local database. In the future we will use web API to build the local database with more products.We can also build a screen to let the user enter the product they are buying, to help us expand our database.</p>
    <h4>Second Slide: How will TrashIndex benefit the future--Located: In my mind (sixth person talking) == Transitioning Slide: What We Learned</h4>
    <p>What I'm going to say: How will TrashIndex benefit the Future? Trash. This is a global problem. And with TrashIndex, we can reduce much of the trash in landfills, oceans, and in our communities. Our idea will show people another defintion of trash. By people buying more environmental-friendly products,
    with lower Trash Index, our Earth will have less trash everywhere. Based on people's buying decisons, industries will make more environment-friendly products and our Earth will be cleaner, better, and more friendly.</p>
    <h4><mark>Kevin</mark> ~ Slide: What We Learned--Located:In the LEFT SECTION (last person talking about poster) == Transitioning Slide: Refrences</h4>
    <p>What you're going to say: Our whole group all learned something this season. Some people learned how to program an Android app. Others learned how to build the robot and program with the EV3 software. And most importantly, everybody learned to work together and complete the tasks together, as a team.</p>
    <h4>Kevin's Second Slide: Refrences--Located: In the RIGHT SECTION (last eprson talking) == Transitioning Slide: Marvin and Ben will demonstrate how our app works.</h4>
    <h3> Next will be up to Ben and Marvin demonstrating the app for IOS and Android!</h3>
