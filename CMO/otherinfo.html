  <h1>My Research Topic, Garbage Enzyme</h1>
  <h2>A Quick Overview about Garbage Enzyme</h2>
  <p>Eco Enzyme, also known as Garbage Enzyme, is a concentrated liquid, a product of a 3-month fermentation made from kitchen
  waste, brown sugar, and water. Kitchen waste includes fruit and vegetable leftovers.</p>
  <h2>What it can Do</h2>
  <p>Garbage Enzyme can act as a cleansing solution. You can use it to clean the floors, dirty stains, dishes, toilets, and cars!
  When you use Garbage Enzyme on your floor, you can get rid of ants, cockroaches,  and other bugs. Sugar is broken down in the
  fermentation process so the brown sugar doesn't attract any bugs. If you use Garbage Enzyme with water, you can make it an air
  freshener that keeps away houseflies. The added mixture can also be used as a natural pesticide keeping plants away from
  infections and insects, and a fertilizer to keep your plants nice and healthy. You have to add a lot of water while dealing 
  with your plants because Garbage Enzyme are usually very strong for plants.</p>
