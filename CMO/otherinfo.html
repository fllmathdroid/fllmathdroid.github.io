  <h2>  Restaurant Waste Oil</h2>
  <h2>  Existing Condition:</h2>
  <p>  Every day, millions of restaurants, fast food places and households use gallons and gallons of cooking oil to prepare foods. After all that cooking is done, what happened to the cooking oil? If you are a single household, you may freeze the oil and throw them into the garbage.
  But if you are a commercial entity, how do you dispose large quantity of waste oil?</p>
  <h2> BIODIESEL!!! </h2>
  <p> What is it? It is a biofuel intended as a substitute for diesel.</p>
  <h2>   Biodiesel Facts</h2>
  <ul>
      <li> Biodiesel runs in any conventional diesel engine. No engine modifications are necessary to use biodiesel.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel dramatically reduces harmful <mark>emissions</mark> that cause environmental problems such as global warming, acid rain and smog. Biodiesel reduces CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions by over 78% compared to petroleum diesel. Even blended with petroleum diesel, biodiesel 
      significantly reduces emissions.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Health problems as a result of emissions exposure are also greatly reduced by the cleaner emissions of biodiesel. According to the American Lung Association, "Biodiesel emissions are 90%, less toxic than <mark>petro-diesel</mark> and will reduce incidents of health hazards such as asthma,
      emphysema and lung cancer.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel is domestically produced. It reduces reliance on big oil corporations like Exxon Mobile and BP. Biodiesel benefits American farmers, American businesses and the national economy. Job creation, new markets for domestic agricultural products and keeping our energy 
      dollars domestic are just a few of the many economic benefits gained by using biodiesel instead of imported petroleum diesel. </li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel is a renewable fuel source. Unlike fossil fuels, biodiesel is made from vegetable oilseed crops grown in America, which replenishes the market annually with renewable feedstock.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel is rapidly biodegradable and non-toxic. Biodiesel handling and use is far less damaging to the environment than petroleum fuel, and is particularly superior in the event of a spill or leak.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel can be stored anywhere that petroleum diesel fuel is stored. All diesel fueling infrastructure including pumps, tanks and transport existing trucks can be used with biodiesel.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel can be used alone or mixed in any amount with petroleum diesel fuel. A 20% blend of biodiesel with diesel fuel is called “B20,” a 5% blend is called “B5” and so on.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel has superior lubrication quality than that of diesel fuel. It increases engine life and can be used to replace sulfur, the acid-rain-causing lubricating agent in petroleum diesel.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel is safer to transport. Biodiesel has a high flash point, or ignition temperature, of about 300 degrees F compared to petroleum diesel fuel, which has a flash point of 125 degrees F.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel has a pleasant aroma in comparison to the toxic smell of petroleum diesel fuel.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel is recognized by the EPA as an alternative fuel and is the only alternative fuel that has successfully completed Tier I and Tier II Health Effects Testing under the Clean Air Act and meets clean diesel standards established by the California Air Resources Board.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel saves money. Engines running on biodiesel have been shown to need less maintenance. </li>
      <br>  
  </ul>
  <h2>  How it's Made</h2>
  <h3> First Step</h3>
  <p> Once the waste oil is put through processing filtration to remove dirt, food particles and water.</p>
  <h3> Last Step</h3>
  <p> Once the oil feedstock is purified, it is transported to a biodiesel facility where methanol, sodium methylate, and heat are added causing a chemical reaction called "transesterification". The reaction yields biodiesel, along with glycerin as its primary byproduct.</p>
  <h3> It can be made at home too!</h3>
  <h2> Solution</h2>
  <p> Growing in popularity, restaurants are turning waste oil into cash when those oil are being sold to companies that produce biodiesel products. Biodiesel is a non-toxic and biodegradable fuel that can power diesel engine and protect the environment at the same time.</p>
  <p> Throughout the world, governments are beginning to realize that in terms of pollution, health, and geo-political stability, petroleum is no longer the fuel of choice. Also, being a finite resource, petroleum oil will only become more expensive as it becomes more scarce. Biodiesel can create an America that is both energy independent and sustainable.</p>
