  <h1>  My Research Topic, Garbage Enzyme</h1>
  <h2>  A Quick Overview about Garbage Enzyme</h2>
  <p>  Eco Enzyme, also known as Garbage Enzyme, is a concentrated liquid, a product of a 3-month fermentation made from kitchen
  waste, brown sugar, and water. Kitchen waste includes fruit and vegetable leftovers.</p>
  <h2>   What it can Do</h2>
  <p>  Garbage Enzyme can act as a cleansing solution. You can use it to clean the floors, dirty stains, dishes, toilets, and cars!
  When you use Garbage Enzyme on your floor, you can get rid of ants, cockroaches,  and other bugs. Sugar is broken down in the
  fermentation process so the brown sugar doesn't attract any bugs. If you use Garbage Enzyme with water, you can make it an air
  freshener that keeps away houseflies. The added mixture can also be used as a natural pesticide keeping plants away from
  infections and insects, and a fertilizer to keep your plants nice and healthy. You have to add a lot of water while dealing 
  with your plants because Garbage Enzyme are usually very strong for plants.</p>
  <h2>  Other Very Important Information</h2>
  <p> Garbage Enzyme was discovered by Dr.Rosukon, a naturopath and organic farmer. This product can improve many global issues,
  such as polluted water and chemical pollution generated from garbage and other sources. Garbage Enzyme will help purify the 
  water by breaking down the brown sugar into acids, gases or alcohol. It can act like a chemical tablet which kills bacteria 
  living in the water. Every 1 liter of Garbage Enzyme can purify 1000 liters of polluted water.</p>
  <h2>  How to Make It</h2>
  <p> The ingredients depend on the size of your plastic bottle but, you need 1 ratio of brown sugar, 3 ratio of kitchen waste,
  and 10 ratio of water. Remember to keep the plastic bottle tight and let the gasses out every night for the first week. After
  3 months, your Garbage Enzyme will be nice and ready for use! You can even speed up the process by adding yeast to the 
  solution.</p>
