  fermentation process so the brown sugar doesn't attract any bugs. If you use Garbage Enzyme with water, you can make it an air
  freshener that keeps away houseflies. The added mixture can also be used as a natural pesticide keeping plants away from
  infections and insects, and a fertilizer to keep your plants nice and healthy. You have to add a lot of water while dealing

  water by breaking down the brown sugar into acids, gases or alcohol. It can act like a chemical tablet which kills bacteria 
  living in the water. Every 1 liter of Garbage Enzyme can purify 1000 liters of polluted water.</p>

  and 10 ratio of water. Remember to keep the plastic bottle tight and let the gasses out every night for the first week. After
  3 months, your Garbage Enzyme will be nice and ready for use! You can even speed up the process by adding yeast to the 
  solution.</p>
