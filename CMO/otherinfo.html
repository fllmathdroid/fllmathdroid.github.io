  <h1>  Restaurant Waste Oil</h1>
  <h2>  Existing Condition:</h2>
  <p>  Every day, millions of restaurants, fast food places and households use gallons and gallons of cooking oil to prepare foods. After all that cooking is done, what happened to the cooking oil? If you are a single household, you may freeze the oil and throw them into the garbage.
  But if you are a commercial entity, how do you dispose large quantity of waste oil?</p>
  <h2>   Biodiesel Facts</h2>
  <ul>
      <li> Biodiesel runs in any conventional diesel engine. No engine modifications are necessary to use biodiesel.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel dramatically reduces harmful emissions that cause environmental problems such as global warming, acid rain and smog. Biodiesel reduces CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions by over 78% compared to petroleum diesel. Even blended with petroleum diesel, biodiesel 
      significantly reduces emissions.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Health problems as a result of emissions exposure are also greatly reduced by the cleaner emissions of biodiesel. According to the American Lung Association, "Biodiesel emissions are 90%, less toxic than petro-diesel and will reduce incidents of health hazards such as asthma,
      emphysema and lung cancer.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel is domestically produced. It reduces reliance on big oil corporations like Exxon Mobile and BP. Biodiesel benefits American farmers, American businesses and the national economy. Job creation, new markets for domestic agricultural products and keeping our energy 
      dollars domestic are just a few of the many economic benefits gained by using biodiesel instead of imported petroleum diesel. </li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel is a renewable fuel source. Unlike fossil fuels, biodiesel is made from vegetable oilseed crops grown in America, which replenishes the market annually with renewable feedstock.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel is rapidly biodegradable and non-toxic. Biodiesel handling and use is far less damaging to the environment than petroleum fuel, and is particularly superior in the event of a spill or leak.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel can be stored anywhere that petroleum diesel fuel is stored. All diesel fueling infrastructure including pumps, tanks and transport existing trucks can be used with biodiesel.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel can be used alone or mixed in any amount with petroleum diesel fuel. A 20% blend of biodiesel with diesel fuel is called “B20,” a 5% blend is called “B5” and so on.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Biodiesel has superior lubrication quality than that of diesel fuel. It increases engine life and can be used to replace sulfur, the acid-rain-causing lubricating agent in petroleum diesel.</li>
      <br>
  </ul>
  <h2>  How to Make It</h2>
  <p> The ingredients depend on the size of your plastic bottle but, you need 1 ratio of brown sugar, 3 ratio of kitchen waste,
  and 10 ratio of water. Remember to keep the plastic bottle tight and let the gasses out every night for the first week. After
  3 months, your Garbage Enzyme will be nice and ready for use! You can even speed up the process by adding yeast to the 
  solution.</p>
