<h1>CBO- Ideas for robots and attachments</h1>
<h1>Main Robot-</h1>
<p>The main robot all our attachments go on- Right now, we want to put 3 large motors(2 to power our wheels) and a
medium motor. For sensors, Marvin and I chose 2 color(that's definite, to align the robot to the board), 1 gyro(to
help with accurate turns), and we currently are still deciding between touch or ultrasonic. If you have any comments
or suggestions, please tell them to me, thanks :D</p>
<h1>THE DOG GEAR SYSTEM</h1>
<p>With something called the dog gear system: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZbt3tnySyI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZbt3tnySyI</a> we can score more points
because this allows us to quickly attach/deattach attachments which are connected to the motor, even when the motor 
is still running. I made a small sample of this: <img src="http://i.cubeupload.com/8UyZMX.jpg"/> the thing at the right is just
an example attachment. THIS WEBPAGE IS NOT FINISHED</p> <br>
