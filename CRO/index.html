		<p> All right, so each team should research Ocean Cleaning. </p>
	
		<h2>Why do we need to clean the ocean</h2>
		<p>The ocean provides us with half of the oxygen we breath everyday, and is an essential part of the water cycle.
		The beaches next to oceans provide sealife like turtles and sea birds nesting grounds and habitat.
		<br>
		Trash in the ocean injures swimmers who bump into it. It harms sealife who get trapped in or eat the trash.
		It also traps boat propellers and drives away tourists. Also, more than 2.6 billion people rely on sealife as a primary source of protein.

                <p>The oceans are overloaded with plastic bags, which can be deadly to sea animal life.
                <br>In a 2014 study, <strong>there are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic littered in the ocean. <br>
                All together, that weighs 26900 TONS </strong>with each plastic piece calulated.
                <br>
                Above info is worthless, because the topic is oil cleaning now. ;-;
